# About me:
- 👋 Hi, I am Daria Aleksich and I live in Cologne.
- 💞️ I am an aspiring Data Scientist/Engineer with background in operations management and administration, passionate about data insights and how to convert it to be useful to others.
- 👀 I am trained in Python and SQL for data handling and visualization and predictive modelling, as well as in AWS and Docker for data engineering and architecture.
- 🌱 I have recently graduated from a super-intensive Data Science bootcamp by 🌶Spiced Academy🌶 in Berlin.
- ✨ Now I am looking for the possibilities of further professional development, preferably in Data Engineering direction, because I particularly enjoy working on engineering projects, which I find the most technically challenging, exciting and rewarding.
