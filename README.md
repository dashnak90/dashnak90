# About me:
- 👋 Hi, I am Daria Aleksich and I live in Cologne.
- 💞️ I am an aspiring Data Scientist with background in business and operations management, passionate about Data and how to convert it to be useful to others.
- 💪🏻 I am trained in Python and SQL for data handling, data visualization and predictive modelling, as well as in AWS and Docker for data engineering and architecture.
- 🌱 I recently graduated from a super-intensive Data Science bootcamp by 🌶Spiced Academy🌶 in Berlin.
- 👀 Now I am looking for further professional development opportunities in the Data Science field, ideally with partial Data Engineering responsibilities, because I particularly enjoyed working on engineering projects, which I found the most technically challenging, but also the most interesting and fulfilling.
